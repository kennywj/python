All programs work on python3

1. translate NCL format netlist firl to internal presentation
	Usage: trans.py <inputfile> [<outputfile>]
	for example:
	$python3 trans.py ../../data/ncl_mac.v result

2. Generate vertex graph from translated result of NCL format netlist file.
	It should first generate edge graph, then do DFS search on edge graph to find all paths from OUTPUT node to INPUT node,
	and then process each path to generate vertex graph.
	The vertex graph is a graph start from OUTPUT node to INPUT node of edge graph.
	The invert graph is a graph start from INPUT node to OUTPUT node of edge graph.
	
	Usage: gen_vgraph.py <inputfile> [output vertex graph file] [output invert vertex file]
	for example:
	$python3 gen_vgraph.py result vgraph.out ivgraph.out

3. Read vertex graph from file to object in memory for furteher processing.
	Usage: file2vgraph.py <input file>
	for example:
	$python3 file2vgraph.py vgraph.out
